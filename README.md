# tensorpack
Neural Network Toolbox based on TensorFlow

In development. No document, don't use.

## Features:
+ Scoped abstraction of common models.
+ Provide callbacks to control training behavior (as in [Keras](http://keras.io)).
+ Use `Dataflow` to gain fine-grained control on data preprocessing.
+ Automatically use the Queue operator in tensorflow to speed up input.
+ Training and testing graph are modeled together, automatically. Just need to follow the conventions to setup stuffs.
