# tensorpack
Neural Network Toolbox based on TensorFlow


## Features:
+ Scoped Abstraction of common models.
+ Provide callbacks to control training behavior (as in [Keras](http://keras.io)).
+ Use `Dataflow` to fine-grained control data preprocessing.
+ Write a config file, tensorpack will do the rest.
