Neural Network Toolbox on TensorFlow

In development. No document.

## Features:
+ Scoped abstraction of common models.
+ Callbacks systems to control different aspects of training.
+ Use `Dataflow` to gain fine-grained control on data preprocessing.
+ Training and testing graph are modeled together. Just need to follow the conventions to setup stuffs.
+ Write summary easier for tensorboard.
