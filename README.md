# tensorpack
Neural Network Toolbox on TensorFlow

In development. No document. See [examples](https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack/tree/master/examples).

## Features:
+ Scoped abstraction of common models.
+ Use `Dataflow` to define data preprocessing in pure Python.
+ Callbacks systems to control training.
+ Training and testing are described together. Just need to follow the conventions to setup stuffs.
+ Write summary easier for tensorboard.
